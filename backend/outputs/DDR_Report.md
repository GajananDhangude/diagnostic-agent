### 1. Property Issue Summary
The subject property exhibits widespread moisture-related distress, primarily manifesting as dampness at skirting levels across multiple living areas and active seepage in the parking facility. The primary drivers of these defects include:
*   **Concealed Plumbing Failures:** Leakages within the internal piping network and drainage joints.
*   **Waterproofing Breaches:** Significant gaps in bathroom tile joints and compromised Nahani trap seals.
*   **Structural Envelope Defects:** Moderate cracking in external walls and reinforced cement concrete (RCC) members (columns/beams) allowing for moisture ingress.

### 2. Area‑wise Observations

#### **A. Hall**
*   **Condition:** Dampness noted at floor level.
*   **Observations:** Visible moisture migration along the skirting level.
*   **Thermal Data:**
    *   **Hotspot:** 28.8°C | **Coldspot:** 23.4°C
    *   **Delta (ΔT):** 5.4°C
    *   **Reference:** Image RB02380X.JPG
*   **Severity:** Moderate

#### **B. Bedroom**
*   **Condition:** Internal wall dampness.
*   **Observations:** Moisture accumulation concentrated at the skirting level.
*   **Thermal Data:**
    *   **Hotspot:** 27.4°C | **Coldspot:** 22.4°C
    *   **Delta (ΔT):** 5.0°C
    *   **Reference:** Image RB02386X.JPG
*   **Severity:** Moderate

#### **C. Master Bedroom**
*   **Condition:** Dampness linked to external wall defects.
*   **Observations:** Combined dampness at skirting and wall surfaces, directly associated with external envelope cracks.
*   **Thermal Data:**
    *   **Hotspot:** 27.0°C | **Coldspot:** 22.0°C
    *   **Delta (ΔT):** 5.0°C
    *   **Reference:** Image RB02395X.JPG
*   **Severity:** Moderate

#### **D. Common Bathroom**
*   **Condition:** Active leakage and systemic plumbing defects.
*   **Observations:** 
    *   Tile hollowness noted across the flooring.
    *   Significant ceiling dampness.
    *   Gaps and efflorescence (blackish dirt/salt deposits) in tile joints.
*   **Technical Defect:** Loose plumbing joints and gaps around the Nahani trap.
*   **Severity:** High

#### **E. External Wall & RCC Members**
*   **Condition:** Surface degradation and structural cracks.
*   **Observations:** 
    *   Moderate cracks identified on the external wall surface and RCC columns/beams.
    *   Biological growth (Algae, fungus, and moss) indicating prolonged moisture retention.
*   **Severity:** Moderate

#### **F. Parking Area**
*   **Condition:** Severe seepage.
*   **Observations:** Active water seepage observed on the ceiling, originating from the bathroom units located on the floors above.
*   **Severity:** High

### 3. Probable Root Cause Analysis

| Probable Cause | Supporting Evidence | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plumbing & Sanitary Failures** | Loose/rusted joints, Nahani trap gaps, confirmed outlet leakage in Flat 203, concealed plumbing failure. | **High** |
| **Waterproofing Failure** | Tile hollowness, blackish dirt in tile joints, active ceiling dampness below wet areas. | **High** |
| **External Envelope Defects** | External surface cracks, biological growth (Algae/Moss), duct issues near Master Bedroom. | **Medium** |

### 4. Severity Assessment
*   **Overall Severity Level:** **Moderate**
*   **Urgency Score:** 7/10
*   **Reasoning:** The inspection identifies systemic dampness across all primary living zones (Hall, Kitchen, Bedrooms) and high-severity seepage in the parking area. The presence of cracks in RCC members and biological growth indicates a risk of structural reinforcement corrosion if left unaddressed.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   Structural corrosion resulting from moisture contact with RCC cracks.
    *   Health hazards (respiratory issues) due to mold, algae, and fungus growth.
    *   Accelerated deterioration of interior aesthetics (paint, plaster, and finishes).
    *   Collateral damage to lower-level units/common areas due to continued seepage.

### 5. Recommended Actions

#### **Immediate Actions (0-1 Month)**
1.  **Rectify Flat 203:** Immediate repair of the outlet leakage to arrest ceiling seepage in the parking area.
2.  **Sanitary Sealing:** Seal all gaps around Nahani trap joints in all bathrooms.
3.  **Hardware Maintenance:** Tighten or replace all loose plumbing joints and flush tank fittings.

#### **Short-Term Actions (1-3 Months)**
1.  **Grouting:** Re-grout bathroom tile joints using high-performance waterproof epoxy or grout.
2.  **Envelope Repair:** Seal external wall cracks and rectify duct-related drainage issues.
3.  **Structural Repair:** Professionally treat moderate cracks observed in RCC columns and beams using appropriate injection or patching compounds.

#### **Long-Term Actions (6 Months+)**
1.  **Protective Coating:** Apply a specialized anti-fungal and hydrophobic coating to the external building facade.
2.  **Comprehensive Waterproofing:** Evaluate and execute full-scale waterproofing for all wet areas (bathrooms/kitchens).
3.  **Monitoring:** Implement a quarterly monitoring schedule for RCC members to check for signs of further corrosion or crack expansion.

### 6. Additional Notes
*   **Persistence:** The leakage is reported by residents to be "active at all times," suggesting a pressurized pipe leak or a constant drainage source.
*   **History:** No records of previous structural audits or comprehensive repair works were available at the time of inspection.
*   **Scientific Validation:** Thermal imaging confirms significant temperature deltas (up to 5.4°C), validating the presence of deep-seated moisture within the masonry.

### 7. Missing or Unclear Information
*   **Unit Identification:** Specific flat/unit number for the primary inspection site is not available.
*   **Contact Information:** Customer phone number and email are not available.
*   **Data Mapping:** Exact location mapping for all 30 thermal images captured during the survey is required for precise repair targeting.
*   **Material Specs:** The manufacturer and type of the existing paint system are not available (relevant for compatibility with new coatings).
