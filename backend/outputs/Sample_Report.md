# Building Diagnostic Report (DDR)

**Date of Inspection:** September 27, 2022  
**Property Type:** Residential Flat (11-Floor Structure)  
**Inspectors:** Krushna & Mahesh  
**Report Status:** Final – High Urgency

---

### 1. Property Issue Summary
The subject property exhibits widespread moisture-related distress, primarily manifesting as dampness at skirting levels across all major living areas, including the hall, kitchen, and bedrooms. Significant water seepage was also identified within the parking zone. Diagnostic findings indicate active concealed plumbing failures, compromised bathroom tile integrity, and structural cracking on external facades. Immediate remediation is required to prevent further structural degradation and the proliferation of biological contaminants.

### 2. Area-wise Observations

#### **Internal Living Areas**
*   **Hall:** 
    *   **Observation:** Significant dampness localized at the skirting level.
    *   **Condition:** Moisture is affecting the perimeter skirting and potentially the wall substrate.
    *   **Thermal Analysis (Ref: RB02380X.JPG):** 
        *   Hotspot: 28.8°C | Coldspot: 23.4°C
        *   **Differential ($\Delta T$):** 5.4°C (Indicates significant moisture concentration/evaporative cooling).
*   **Bedroom:** 
    *   **Observation:** Active dampness at the skirting level base.
    *   **Condition:** Continuous moisture presence at the wall-floor junction.
*   **Master Bedroom:** 
    *   **Observation:** Dampness extending from the skirting level onto the main wall surfaces.
    *   **Condition:** Multiple damp spots observed, suggesting possible lateral migration of moisture.
*   **Kitchen:** 
    *   **Observation:** Moisture ingress identified at the skirting level.
    *   **Condition:** Active base-level dampness.

#### **Wet Areas & External**
*   **Common Bathroom:** 
    *   **Observation:** High-severity ceiling dampness originating from the unit above (Flat 203). 
    *   **Structural/Finishes:** Evidence of hollow tiles on floors and walls.
    *   **Plumbing:** Visible leakages at outlets and loose plumbing joints. Open tile joints are facilitating water penetration into the sub-floor (brickbat coba).
    *   **Condition:** Critical failure of internal waterproofing and plumbing systems.
*   **External Wall:** 
    *   **Observation:** Moderate cracking across the external facade, including RCC columns and beams.
    *   **Biological Growth:** Visible accumulation of algae, fungus, and moss on the external envelope.
    *   **Condition:** Compromised building envelope allowing for moisture transition.
*   **Parking Area:** 
    *   **Observation:** Significant seepage observed on ceilings and walls.
    *   **Condition:** Active water transmission from upper structural elements/wet areas.

### 3. Probable Root Cause Analysis

| Probable Cause | Supporting Evidence | Confidence Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concealed Plumbing Failure** | Consistent "all-time" leakage; checklist confirmation of concealed pipe leaks; loose/rusted joints. | **High** |
| **Waterproofing & Grout Failure** | Blackish dirt/gaps in tile joints; gaps around Nahani traps; damage to brickbat coba layers. | **High** |
| **Structural & External Cracking** | Moderate cracks in RCC members (beams/columns); external wall duct issues. | **Medium** |

### 4. Severity Assessment

*   **Overall Severity:** **HIGH**
*   **Urgency Score:** 8/10
*   **Reasoning:** The property is experiencing active, "all-time" leakage across nearly every functional area. The combination of inter-floor leakage (from Flat 203) and internal concealed plumbing failure poses a high risk to structural integrity and the longevity of internal finishes.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   Active concealed plumbing leaks.
    *   Structural RCC cracks in columns and beams.
    *   Biological growth (Algae/Fungus) posing potential health risks.
    *   Unresolved inter-floor seepage from Flat 203.

### 5. Recommended Actions

#### **Phase I: Immediate Interventions (0–15 Days)**
1.  **Source Control (Flat 203):** Coordinate repairs for outlet leakage and open tile joints in the flat directly above the common bathroom.
2.  **Sanitary Sealing:** Seal all gaps around Nahani Trap joints and execute professional regrouting of all open bathroom tile joints.
3.  **Plumbing Repair:** Address identified active leaks in the common bathroom plumbing manifold.

#### **Phase II: Short-Term Remediation (15–45 Days)**
1.  **Diagnostic Testing:** Perform pressure testing on all concealed plumbing lines to pinpoint specific pipe failures.
2.  **Structural Stabilization:** Inject epoxy or polyurethane (PU) grout into identified RCC cracks to arrest moisture ingress.
3.  **Facade Maintenance:** Chemically clean external walls to remove biological growth and apply a high-build protective waterproof coating.

#### **Phase III: Long-Term Management**
1.  **Waterproofing Overhaul:** Implement a comprehensive, multi-layer waterproofing treatment for all "wet" areas (bathrooms/kitchen).
2.  **Structural Audits:** Establish a schedule for periodic structural audits given the visible cracking in load-bearing members.
3.  **Maintenance:** Maintain external sealants and high-elasticity paint integrity.

### 6. Additional Notes
*   **Thermal Imaging:** Confirmed significant temperature deltas in damp zones, validating the presence of deep-seated moisture.
*   **Historical Data:** No records of previous structural audits or major repair works were provided.
*   **Compliance:** The property achieved a score of 85.71% on the standard checklist, despite the critical nature of the flagged issues.
